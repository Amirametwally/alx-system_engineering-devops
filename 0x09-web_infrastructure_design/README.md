Servers are physical machines (as hardwares), virtual machines or softwares (computer programs) that serve or provide functionality to other programs or devices called “clients”. The term server comes from queuing theory used in Kendall’s notation, where servers serve or process the clients requirements in the same way as a telephone operator, a cooker or a production machine process incoming orders, having in mind its capacity and service process time.

A computer can function as a server, and a server can be a computer, both of them being built up with hardware and software. However, the main difference between these two is the capacity and computer power servers have. In other words, servers are computers on steroids with faster processing capacity. They are usually stored in data centers racks (stacks of servers piled one on top of each other).

On the other hand, virtual servers function more like virtual machines, or virtual computers. These are a virtual representation of the physical servers, having their own operating system and applications (Posey, 2021).

The fundamental role of a Web Server

The main function of a Web server is to store the files of a site and broadcast them over the Internet so that they can be visited by users. Basically, a web server is a large computer that stores and transmits data via the network system called the Internet. When a user enters an Internet page, his browser communicates with the server sending and receiving data that determines what he sees on the screen. Therefore, we say that Web servers are to store and transmit data from a site as requested by a visitor’s browser.

What is the role of the application server
The application server is the intermediary between browser-based databases and back-end databases and legacy systems. In many uses, the application server combines or works with a web server (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and is called a web application server.
